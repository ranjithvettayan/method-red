# update_phase_from_stages.sh — derive scope.json.current_phase from
# the stage distribution in cases.db. Replaces hand-written `jq` calls
# that flipped current_phase based on hard-coded sequencing.
#
# Mapping:
#   - any in-flight processing for recon-specialist / source-analyzer
#     during initial discovery → recon
#   - cases.db growing rapidly + most cases at ingested → collect
#   - active stages (ingested|vuln_confirmed|fuzz_pending) > 0
#     and no exploit-developer in flight → consume_test
#   - any case at vuln_confirmed OR exploit-developer in flight → exploit
#   - report-writer running, no other in-flight, no active stages → report
#   - everything terminal → complete
#
# Idempotent. Only updates scope.json when the derived phase changes.
