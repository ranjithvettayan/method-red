# A01:2025 — Broken Access Control

- Verify CORS policy: `run_tool curl -I -H "Origin: https://evil.com" https://target/api/`
- Test force browsing to authenticated/privileged URLs without credentials
- Check HTTP method tampering (change GET to PUT/DELETE on restricted resources)
- Test JWT tampering: modify claims, use "none" algorithm, forge signatures
- Test parameter tampering: modify user IDs, role fields, permission flags in requests
- Check CSRF protections on state-changing operations
