# Adversary Emulation — index & methodology

**Adversary emulation** reproduces a *specific, named* threat actor's tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) — drawn from real, attributed intelligence —
to test whether the target's people, process, and tooling detect and respond
the way they should. It is distinct from generic penetration testing
(opportunistic) and from *simulation* (abstract/random): emulation is
**threat-informed** — every action traces to something a real group has been
documented doing, mapped to [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).

> **Authorized use only.** Emulate an actor's TTPs **only** within the engagement's
> Rules of Engagement and approved scope. Destructive techniques (Impact tactic:
> ransomware, wipers, ICS manipulation) are emulated as *non-destructive proofs*
> (e.g., a benign canary file, a dry-run) unless the RoE explicitly authorizes
> otherwise. The goal is to measure detection, not to cause damage.

## When to use this

- The operator (or `roe.json` threat profile) names a specific actor to emulate,
  or names a sector/region whose dominant threat is a known group.
- A purple-team / ATT&CK-evaluation engagement: run an actor's TTP chain while the
  blue cell measures detection (see `kill-chain-analysis` and the `blue_cell`).
- You want a *realistic, defensible* attack plan instead of an ad-hoc one.

## Methodology (5 steps)

1. **Select the actor.** Map the engagement's industry/region/crown-jewels to a
   relevant group (see the catalog below). When unsure, ask the operator via
   `ask_user_question`. Record the choice in the OPPLAN.
2. **Load the profile.** `load_skill <slug>` (e.g. `load_skill apt29-cozy-bear`).
   Each profile carries attribution, targeting, dated campaigns, the actor's TTPs
   mapped to ATT&CK technique IDs, signature tooling, **emulation guidance** (how
   to reproduce each TTP with Decepticon's own tools), and detection notes.
3. **Scope to RoE.** Intersect the actor's TTPs with the approved scope. Drop or
   down-scope anything out of bounds (e.g., replace a real wiper with a canary).
   Forbidden-destination / out-of-scope checks still apply at tool-call time.
4. **Emulate in kill-chain order.** Walk Initial Access → Execution → Persistence
   → Priv-Esc → Defense Evasion → Credential Access → Discovery → Lateral Movement
   → Collection → C2 → Exfiltration → (proof-of) Impact, using only the techniques
   this actor is known for. Cite the ATT&CK ID in each finding.
5. **Measure & report.** Record which actions the blue cell detected/blocked vs.
   missed (`kill-chain-analysis`, MTTD), and produce a threat-informed report that
   ties each result to the emulated actor + ATT&CK technique. Feeds the final report.

This complements `soundwave/threat-profile` (which picks the actor at planning time)
and `kill-chain-analysis` (which scores detection across the chain).
