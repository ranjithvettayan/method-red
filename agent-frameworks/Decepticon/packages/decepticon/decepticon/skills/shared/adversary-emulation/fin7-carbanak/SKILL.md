# FIN7 (Carbanak, Carbon Spider, Sangria Tempest) — Adversary Emulation Profile

FIN7 (MITRE ATT&CK **G0046**; also tracked as Carbanak, Carbon Spider, Sangria Tempest, GOLD NIAGARA, ELBRUS, and ITG14) is one of the most prolific and best-documented financially motivated cybercrime groups, active since at least 2013. Originally infamous for large-scale point-of-sale (POS) intrusions to steal payment-card data — operating behind the front company "Combi Security" — the group pivoted to "big game hunting" ransomware around 2020, running its own Darkside/BlackMatter Ransomware-as-a-Service and acting as an affiliate/tooling supplier for REvil, Cl0p, Black Basta, ALPHV/BlackCat, LockBit, and others. FIN7 is characterized by disciplined operational tradecraft: convincing social engineering (including spearphishing of IT staff and physically mailed BadUSB drives), heavily obfuscated custom loaders (POWERTRASH), signature backdoors (Carbanak/Anunak, Lizar/Diceloader), purchased/cracked commercial tooling (Cobalt Strike, Core Impact), and a productized EDR-killer (AvNeutralizer/AuKill) sold on criminal forums.

## Attribution & motivation
- **Sponsor / nation:** Not a state-sponsored actor. FIN7 is an organized **criminal enterprise** assessed by multiple vendors to be Russian-speaking / Russia-based, with confirmed Ukrainian national members (per the 2018 U.S. DOJ indictment).
- **Motivation:** **Financial.** Early operations monetized stolen payment-card data sold on carding/darknet markets; later operations monetize via ransomware extortion (own RaaS brands and as a ransomware affiliate) and by selling intrusion tooling (e.g., the AvNeutralizer EDR killer) to other crews.
- **Confidence:** **High** for the activity cluster and financial motivation (corroborated by DOJ indictments/convictions and consistent CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Microsoft, SentinelOne, and Secureworks reporting). Note that the "Carbanak" backdoor has been used by more than one actor, so backdoor-only attributions to FIN7 should be treated with lower confidence than TTP-clustered attributions.

## Targeting
- **Sectors:** Historically heavy on **retail, restaurant, hospitality, and gaming** (POS-era payment-card theft). Post-2020 ransomware era broadened to **software, consulting, financial services, medical equipment/pharmaceutical, cloud services, media, food & beverage, transportation, utilities, manufacturing, legal, and the public sector**, plus the **automotive** industry.
- **Regions:** Predominantly the **United States** (the DOJ described theft of card data from 100+ U.S. companies across 47 states), with European victims also reported.
- **Victim profile:** During POS operations, customer-facing businesses processing large card volumes. In the ransomware/BGH era, victim selection is revenue-driven (targets filtered by company revenue using ZoomInfo) and FIN7 specifically phishes **IT staff with elevated administrative privileges** to accelerate domain compromise.

## Notable campaigns
- **2017 — Restaurant/retail POS theft (Chipotle and others):** Large-scale spearphishing of hospitality/restaurant chains delivering Carbanak/HALFBAKED and POS scrapers (e.g., Pillowmint) to harvest payment-card data. *(CrowdStrike, Secureworks GOLD NIAGARA)*
- **2018 — Saks Fifth Avenue / Lord & Taylor breach:** POS compromise of high-end retailers exposing roughly 5 million payment cards sold on darknet markets. *(Multiple vendor reporting)*
- **Aug 1, 2018 — DOJ indictment & arrests:** Three Ukrainian nationals (Fedir Hladyr, Dmytro Fedorov, Andrii Kolpakov) charged; the indictment exposed the **Combi Security** front company used to recruit operators. *(CrowdStrike "Arrests Put New Focus on CARBON SPIDER")*
- **2020 — Pivot to big game hunting:** FIN7 stands up its own RaaS (**Darkside**, later **BlackMatter**) and begins deploying ransomware as the end objective. *(CrowdStrike "CARBON SPIDER Embraces Big Game Hunting")*
- **Apr 2021 — Member sentencing:** Fedir Hladyr sentenced to 10 years following a 2019 guilty plea. *(CrowdStrike / DOJ)*
- **Oct 2021 — "Bastion Secure" fake-pentest-firm scheme:** FIN7 ran a sham security company to hire legitimate penetration testers/IT specialists who unknowingly performed ransomware-intrusion work. *(Vendor reporting)*
- **2022 — "Checkmarks" automated exploitation platform:** FIN7 built an automated attack system mass-exploiting public-facing Microsoft Exchange via ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) with an Auto-SQLi (SQLMap) module; intrusions hit U.S. manufacturing, legal, and public-sector firms (medium-confidence attribution). *(SentinelOne "FIN7 Reboot")*
- **2022 onward — AvNeutralizer / AuKill EDR-killer:** FIN7 developed an EDR-tampering tool (first operational use ~mid-2022; an updated version abuses the Windows `ProcLaunchMon.sys`/Process Explorer driver) and sold it on criminal forums; used by Black Basta and later multiple ransomware crews. *(SentinelOne, IBM)*
- **Apr 2023 — Return with Cl0p ransomware (Sangria Tempest):** Microsoft observed FIN7 use **POWERTRASH** to load the **Lizar** post-exploitation tool, then **OpenSSH** and **Impacket** for lateral movement before deploying **Cl0p** ransomware. *(Microsoft / The Hacker News)*
- **Late 2023 (reported Apr 2024) — Automaker IT-staff spearphishing:** FIN7 phished privileged IT employees at a large U.S.-based multinational automaker using a typosquatted Advanced IP Scanner site (`advanced-ip-sccanner[.]com` → `myipscanner[.]com`), a Dropbox-hosted `WsTaskLoad.exe`, POWERTRASH, the **Anunak/Carbanak** backdoor, and OpenSSH for persistence. *(BlackBerry / BleepingComputer)*

## Emulation guidance (Decepticon)
> **Authorized use only:** Execute these emulation steps **strictly inside the agreed engagement scope and rules of engagement**, with written authorization, against in-scope assets only — never against third parties or production data you are not cleared to touch. Use benign substitutes for destructive impact actions.

Map FIN7's signature chain to Decepticon's own capabilities:

- **Initial access (phishing IT staff) — T1566.001/.002, T1204, T1583.001:** Use Decepticon's phishing/social-engineering workflow to stand up a **typosquatted "IT tool" landing page** (mimic Advanced IP Scanner) and deliver a benign tracked payload via a cloud-share link (Dropbox-style). Prioritize recipients with admin rights, mirroring FIN7's IT-staff focus. Stage decoy infra via the cloud skills (look-alike domain + object-storage hosting, T1583.006/T1608.001).
- **BadUSB drop — T1091/T1674:** If physical-access testing is in scope, emulate the mailed-USB vector with a HID/keystroke-injection device that triggers a benign PowerShell beacon download. Otherwise document the vector without execution.
- **Loader & in-memory execution — T1059.001/T1620/T1027:** Use the **bash/PowerShell tooling** plus the **defense-evasion skill** to reproduce a POWERTRASH-style obfuscated reflective PE loader (string fragmentation, junk code, in-memory load) delivering your C2 stage — do not drop a payload to disk.
- **C2 — T1071.004/T1102.002/T1572/T1219:** Drive C2 through the **c2/sliver** skill. Emulate FIN7's channel diversity: an HTTP(S) Sliver listener, a DNS listener (mirrors T1071.004), web-service C2 (mirror T1102.002), with **OpenSSH reverse-tunnel** egress (T1572) and an RMM-style channel as a fallback. Configure non-standard ports (T1571) to test egress controls.
- **Discovery & cred access — T1087.002/T1069.002/T1558.003/T1003:** Use the **Active Directory skills** to enumerate domain admins/groups (`net group`, csvde-equivalent), then perform **Kerberoasting** and credential extraction (Mimikatz-equivalent via the AD/cred-access tooling) exactly as FIN7 chains recon → Kerberoast → lateral movement.
- **Lateral movement — T1021.001/.004/.005/T1572:** Use the **lateral-movement skill** for RDP, SSH, VNC, and Impacket/CrackMapExec-style remote execution to traverse to high-value hosts (Exchange, hypervisors, file servers).
- **Defense evasion / EDR tampering — T1562.001/T1553.002:** With the **defense-evasion skill**, emulate AvNeutralizer-style EDR-tamper *detection testing* (e.g., attempt to stop/blind the agreed test sensor in a controlled VM) and code-signing/masquerading of artifacts — never disable production security controls outside an isolated test host.
- **Exchange/ProxyShell + Auto-SQLi — T1190/T1195.002:** If web-facing assets are in scope, emulate the "Checkmarks" pattern with the **cloud/web-exploitation tooling** (ProxyShell-class checks, SQLi probing) against the designated test target only.
- **Impact (ransomware) — T1486:** **Do not encrypt real data.** Emulate the BGH end-state with a **benign canary "ransom" routine** (touch marker files / rename in an isolated directory) and stage a simulated exfil-then-encrypt to MEGA-like storage (T1567.002) to exercise blue-cell DLP and backup detection.

## Detection & defense
- **Phishing of privileged IT staff (T1566/T1204):** Detect typosquatted domains impersonating admin tools (Advanced IP Scanner, etc.); alert on cloud-share downloads of EXE/MSI by IT-admin accounts; block/inspect newly registered look-alike domains; enforce mark-of-the-web and macro/DDE disablement on Office.
- **BadUSB / HID injection (T1091/T1674):** Enforce USB device-control policy; alert on a "keyboard" enumerating immediately followed by PowerShell network egress.
- **POWERTRASH / in-memory loaders (T1059.001/T1620/T1027):** Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging, AMSI, and Module Logging; alert on reflective `Assembly::Load` / in-memory PE patterns, `certutil` decoding, and heavily obfuscated/fragmented script content.
- **Persistence (T1547.001/T1543.003/T1053.005/T1569.002):** Monitor new Run keys, new services, scheduled tasks with masquerading names ("AdobeFlashSync"), and `sc start sshd` / unexpected `sshd` services on Windows.
- **Lateral movement & cred access (T1021/T1558.003/T1003):** Alert on Kerberoast TGS-REQ bursts (RC4), LSASS access, Impacket/CrackMapExec patterns, and anomalous RDP/SSH/VNC between workstations and servers; deploy honey SPNs.
- **C2 (T1071.004/T1102.002/T1572/T1219):** Inspect/limit outbound DNS (large TXT/OPT volume), monitor for SSH reverse tunnels from non-admin hosts, baseline use of Google Docs/Scripts/Pastebin and Atera/other RMM agents; block unsanctioned RMM.
- **EDR tampering (T1562.001):** Enable tamper protection; monitor for vulnerable-driver loads (e.g., `ProcLaunchMon.sys`, Process Explorer driver) and BYOVD patterns; alert on security-service stop/kill events.
- **Exploitation (T1190/T1210):** Patch Exchange ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473/-34523/-31207) and ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472); monitor Exchange for webshell drops and Auto-SQLi/SQLMap signatures.
- **Impact (T1486/T1567.002):** Protect/segment ESXi management; immutable, offline backups; DLP and egress monitoring for MEGA/cloud-storage bulk uploads; alert on mass-rename/encryption file events.
