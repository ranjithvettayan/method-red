# APT28 (Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard, Sofacy, STRONTIUM) — Adversary Emulation Profile

APT28 (MITRE ATT&CK **G0007**) is a long-running cyber-espionage group attributed to Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS), **military unit 26165**, operating since at least 2004. Across two decades it has hit governments, militaries, diplomatic bodies, defense and aerospace, anti-doping and chemical-weapons watchdogs, media, and — since 2022 — Western logistics and IT firms supporting Ukraine. APT28 is best characterized by disciplined credential operations (spearphishing, large-scale password spraying, NTLM-coercion), pragmatic use of N-day exploits (Outlook, Exchange, WinRAR, Windows Print Spooler), a broad cross-platform malware stable (Windows/Linux/macOS/Android, plus the LoJax UEFI rootkit), and a willingness to pivot from pure espionage into influence, hack-and-leak, and occasional destructive/DDoS operations. This profile maps its tradecraft to ATT&CK so Decepticon can emulate it inside an authorized engagement and the blue cell can anticipate detection.

## Attribution & motivation

- **Sponsor / nation:** Russian Federation — GRU 85th GTsSS, Military Unit 26165. The 2018 U.S. DOJ indictments named specific GRU officers of Units 26165 and 74455; the UK, EU, and France have formally attributed multiple campaigns to this unit.
- **Motivation:** Primarily **strategic intelligence collection (espionage)** aligned with Russian state interests — military, diplomatic, and political intelligence. Secondary motivations include **influence / information operations** (hack-and-leak against the 2016 U.S. election, WADA athlete data dumps) and occasional **destructive / disruptive** action (TV5Monde disruption, WADA DDoS).
- **Attribution confidence:** **High.** Backed by U.S. DOJ criminal indictments and coordinated government attributions (UK NCSC, EU, France ANSSI/MFA) plus consistent named vendor reporting (Microsoft, Mandiant, Palo Alto Unit 42, ESET).

## Targeting

- **Sectors:** Government and diplomatic bodies; defense, military, and aerospace; **logistics, transport, and IT/technology firms supporting aid to Ukraine** (since 2022); think tanks, NGOs, and political organizations/campaigns; media; anti-doping (WADA, USADA) and chemical-weapons bodies (OPCW, Spiez); critical infrastructure and energy.
- **Regions:** NATO and allied states — heavy focus on Ukraine, Western/Eastern Europe (notably Germany, France, Poland, the Baltics), North America, and international organizations.
- **Victim profile:** High-value strategic targets — individuals and orgs whose mailboxes, credentials, and documents yield military, political, or diplomatic intelligence. Frequently targets webmail (Outlook/OWA, Roundcube, Yahoo/Google) and edge/network devices as footholds.

## Notable campaigns

- **2015-04 — TV5Monde disruption.** French broadcaster's 11 channels and online presence knocked offline behind a false "CyberCaliphate" hacktivist persona; French investigators and infrastructure overlap tied it to APT28. (securityaffairs / Wikipedia background)
- **2015 — German Bundestag intrusion.** Compromise of the German federal parliament network; the UK later sanctioned GRU Unit 26165 officers for it. (gov.uk)
- **2016 — U.S. election interference (DNC / DCCC / Clinton campaign).** Spearphishing and credential theft, lateral movement DCCC→DNC, and hack-and-leak. Detailed in the July 2018 DOJ/Mueller indictment of 12 GRU officers. (justice.gov / FBI)
- **2014-2018 — WADA / USADA / OPCW / Spiez.** Remote and close-access ("Wi-Fi") operations against anti-doping and chemical-weapons bodies, including a 2016 DDoS and leak of athlete medical data; charged in the October 2018 DOJ indictment of seven GRU officers. (justice.gov / NPR)
- **2018 — LoJax UEFI rootkit.** ESET documented the first in-the-wild UEFI rootkit, used by APT28 for firmware-level persistence surviving OS reinstall. (MITRE software S0397 / ESET)
- **2022-2025 — Western logistics & tech targeting (aid to Ukraine).** Joint CISA advisory **AA25-141A**: password spraying, spearphishing, Outlook NTLM coercion (CVE-2023-23397), Roundcube CVEs (CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026), and WinRAR (CVE-2023-38831) against logistics/IT firms and IP-camera networks. (CISA AA25-141A)
- **2023 — Outlook NTLM (CVE-2023-23397) exploitation.** Zero-click NTLM-hash theft via crafted Outlook calendar reminders; documented by Microsoft and Unit 42 ("Fighting Ursa"). (microsoft.com / unit42)
- **2024-04 — GooseEgg / Print Spooler (CVE-2022-38028).** Microsoft disclosed APT28's custom GooseEgg launcher abusing Windows Print Spooler for SYSTEM-level privilege escalation; CISA added the CVE to the KEV catalog. (microsoft.com)
- **2023-04 — Cisco router operations.** Joint CISA/NCSC advisory **AA23-108** on APT28 exploiting SNMP weaknesses (CVE-2017-6742) to deploy "Jaguar Tooth" and conduct reconnaissance on Cisco IOS routers. (CISA AA23-108)
- **2025-04/07 — France formal attribution.** France's MFA/ANSSI publicly attributed a decade of intrusions against French entities (incl. TV5Monde lineage and government/defense targets) to APT28. (diplomatie.gouv.fr)

## Emulation guidance (Decepticon)

> **Authorized-use caveat:** Execute the following ONLY within the documented rules of engagement, target scope, and time window of an authorized engagement. Never run destructive (T1561/T1498) or firmware (LoJax-style) actions outside an explicitly sanctioned, isolated lab.

Map APT28's signature plays to Decepticon's own capabilities:

- **Initial access — credential ops (T1110.003, T1598.003, T1566.001).** Use the phishing/credential-harvest skill to stand up lookalike webmail login pages; drive **slow, low-and-slow password spraying** (~few attempts/account/hour) against in-scope OWA/M365 endpoints, fronted through rotating egress to mimic Tor/VPN spray infra. Stage macro/RAR lures with the payload-builder; if WinRAR is in scope, emulate CVE-2023-38831 archive lures.
- **NTLM coercion (T1187 / CVE-2023-23397, T1557.001).** With the AD/lateral-movement skill, run **Responder** for LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning and emulate Outlook-reminder NTLM coercion to capture Net-NTLM hashes, then relay or crack offline. This is APT28's defining 2023-2025 play — prioritize it.
- **Privilege escalation (T1068, T1548.002).** Use the privesc/defense-evasion skill to emulate **GooseEgg-style Print Spooler abuse (CVE-2022-38028)** for SYSTEM in a patched-vs-unpatched lab, and UAC bypass chains analogous to Koadic/Downdelph.
- **Credential access (T1003.*, T1558.*, T1550.002).** Drive the AD skill / **Mimikatz** for LSASS dump, DCSync, golden/silver tickets, and pass-the-hash — mirroring APT28's domain-takeover pattern.
- **C2 (T1071.001, T1102.002, T1090, T1572).** Use **Sliver** (c2 skill) over HTTPS as the primary channel; add a **mail-protocol or Google-Drive web-service profile** to emulate Cannon/Drive C2, and chain `netsh portproxy` internal proxies + reGeorg-style web-shell tunneling for pivoting.
- **Cloud / token theft (T1528, T1098.002, T1114.002, T1213.002).** With the cloud/M365 skill, emulate OAuth-app consent abuse, ApplicationImpersonation/delegate-permission grants, and bulk mailbox + SharePoint collection.
- **Collection & exfil (T1560.001, T1030, T1048.002, T1567).** Use bash/PowerShell to archive with password-protected RAR/`Compress-Archive`, **split into <1MB chunks**, and exfil over HTTPS through a compromised OWA-equivalent or a web service to reproduce the signature exfil pattern.
- **Edge devices (T1602, T1133).** Where routers/IP cameras are in scope, emulate SNMP/credential weaknesses (cf. AA23-108) to recon network-device config — APT28 favors edge footholds.

## Detection & defense

- **NTLM coercion / CVE-2023-23397:** Patch Outlook; block outbound SMB (TCP 445) and WebDAV at the perimeter; add high-value users to the **Protected Users** group; hunt for Exchange messages with `PidLidReminderFileParameter` UNC paths; alert on outbound NTLM to external hosts.
- **Password spraying (T1110.003):** Enforce **phishing-resistant MFA**; alert on distributed low-rate auth failures across many accounts from rotating/Tor/VPN IPs; disable legacy/basic auth on M365/OWA; monitor impossible-travel and new-ASN sign-ins.
- **Print Spooler / GooseEgg (CVE-2022-38028):** Apply Oct-2022+ patches; disable the Spooler where not needed; monitor for `spoolsv.exe` spawning cmd/PowerShell and writes to Spooler driver/JS-constraints paths.
- **Credential dumping (T1003.*):** Enable LSA protection (RunAsPPL) and Credential Guard; alert on LSASS handle access, `ntdsutil`/`vssadmin` shadow-copy creation, and `reg save` of SAM/SYSTEM/SECURITY; monitor DCSync replication from non-DC accounts.
- **OAuth/delegation abuse (T1528, T1098.002):** Audit enterprise app consent and mailbox `Add-MailboxPermission`/ApplicationImpersonation role grants; restrict user consent; review delegate/forwarding rules.
- **Web shells & tunneling (T1505.003, T1572, T1090.001):** Monitor OWA/IIS directories for new aspx/script files (reGeorg); alert on `netsh interface portproxy add`; baseline web-server child processes.
- **Persistence (T1547, T1137.002, T1542.003):** Monitor Run keys, `UserInitMprLogonScript`, Office Test registry keys; deploy Secure Boot + firmware integrity (against LoJax-class UEFI implants).
- **Edge/network devices (T1602):** Replace default SNMP community strings, restrict SNMP to management VLANs, patch Cisco IOS (cf. CVE-2017-6742), and monitor for unexpected config reads (Jaguar Tooth pattern).
- **Exfiltration (T1030, T1048.002, T1567):** DLP/egress monitoring for chunked password-protected archives and uploads to Google Drive / unusual HTTPS endpoints, especially staged from mail servers.
