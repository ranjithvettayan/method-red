# APT41 (Double Dragon, Wicked Panda, BARIUM) — Adversary Emulation Profile

APT41 (MITRE ATT&CK **G0096**; also tracked as Double Dragon, Wicked Panda, Winnti, BARIUM, and Microsoft's **Brass Typhoon**) is a prolific Chinese threat actor unique for running **state-sponsored cyber-espionage in parallel with financially motivated cybercrime** — often reusing the same non-public malware for both missions. First publicly profiled by FireEye/Mandiant in August 2019, the group has been active since at least 2012, beginning in the video-game economy (virtual-currency theft, ransomware, code-signing certificate theft) and expanding into wide-ranging espionage. APT41 is best known for **software supply-chain compromises** (poisoning legitimately signed installers), rapid weaponization of newly disclosed vulnerabilities, abuse of **stolen code-signing certificates**, and a deep, modular toolset spanning Windows and Linux. This profile maps APT41's documented TTPs to ATT&CK so Decepticon can emulate them under authorized scope and the blue cell can anticipate detection.

## Attribution & motivation

- **Suspected sponsor / nation:** People's Republic of China. Mandiant assesses APT41 operates under the **MSS (Ministry of State Security) contractor model** — nominally private companies executing intelligence taskings for provincial MSS bureaus — rather than the PLA model. The group is operationally linked to the Chengdu-based front company **Chengdu 404 Network Technology Co., Ltd.**
- **Motivation:** **Dual-mandate.** Espionage (intellectual property, strategic intelligence, surveillance of dissidents/pro-democracy figures) interleaved with **financial gain** (game virtual-currency manipulation, ransomware, cryptomining). Mandiant observed espionage during Beijing business hours and financially motivated activity during off-hours, suggesting moonlighting on shared infrastructure.
- **Confidence:** **High** for China nexus and dual motivation. The U.S. DOJ on **September 16, 2020** indicted five Chinese nationals (Zhang Haoran, Tan Dailin, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, Fu Qiang) and two Malaysian accomplices (Wong Ong Hua, Ling Yang Ching) in connection with attacks on 100+ victims globally, lending strong public attribution. Specific operation-to-operator mapping within individual intrusions carries lower confidence.

## Targeting

- **Sectors:** Video games & game publishers, software/IT and computer hardware, telecommunications (incl. call-record interception), healthcare & pharmaceuticals, high-tech/semiconductors, media & entertainment, shipping & logistics, automotive, financial services, education, think tanks, and government.
- **Regions:** Global — North America, Europe (Italy, Spain, UK), East and Southeast Asia (Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea), the Middle East (Turkey), and beyond. U.S. **state governments** were a notable target.
- **Victim profile:** Both broad opportunistic compromise (any org running a freshly exploitable internet-facing app) and deliberate strategic targeting. Notably includes **Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and politicians** and individuals of intelligence interest, alongside large enterprises and supply-chain "watering hole" vendors used to reach downstream customers.

## Notable campaigns

- **2012–2019 — Video-game economy & supply-chain origins.** Members conducted financially motivated game-currency theft and ransomware, then injected malicious code into legitimately signed software. APT41 is associated with the **CCleaner (2017)** and **ASUS Live Update / "Operation ShadowHammer" (2018)** supply-chain compromises and the **ShadowPad** privately-sold backdoor. (FireEye/Mandiant 2019; Kaspersky Securelist; SentinelLabs)
- **August 2019 — Public attribution.** FireEye publishes "**APT41: A Dual Espionage and Cyber Crime Operation**," formally naming the group and documenting its dual mandate. (Mandiant)
- **Jan–Mar 2020 — Global exploitation wave.** Mandiant observed APT41 attempt to exploit Citrix NetScaler/ADC (CVE-2019-19781), Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central (CVE-2020-10189) across 75+ customers — one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese actor observed at the time. (Mandiant)
- **September 16, 2020 — DOJ indictments.** U.S. charges seven defendants ("APT41 actors") for intrusions against 100+ organizations; FBI adds five to Cyber's Most Wanted. (DOJ / TechCrunch / BleepingComputer)
- **May 2021 – Feb 2022 (Campaign C0017) — U.S. state government networks.** APT41 compromised at least six U.S. state governments by exploiting internet-facing web apps, including a **zero-day in the USAHerds livestock application (CVE-2021-44207)** and **Log4j (CVE-2021-44228)** within hours of disclosure; deployed custom loaders (DEADEYE), KEYPLUG, and DUSTPAN. (Mandiant, "APT41 Targeting U.S. State Government Networks")
- **Jan 2023 – Jun 2024 (Campaign C0040, "APT41 DUST") / July 2024 report — DUSTTRAP campaign.** Sustained intrusions into shipping/logistics, media, technology, and automotive orgs in Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the UK. Chain: **ANTSWORD/BLUEBEAM web shells → DUSTPAN/DUSTTRAP droppers → BEACON (Cobalt Strike)**; DUSTTRAP decrypts payloads in memory and was signed with **stolen code-signing certificates** (one tied to a South Korean gaming company). Oracle DB exfiltration via SQLULDR2/PINEGROVE to OneDrive. (Google Cloud / Mandiant + Google TAG, "APT41 Has Arisen From the DUST")

- **Commodity / public / dual-use:** Cobalt Strike BEACON (S0154), Empire (S0363), Mimikatz (S0002), Impacket (S0357 — incl. wmiexec), PowerSploit (S0194), pwdump (S0006), Windows Credential Editor, ProcDump, BrowserGhost, sqlmap (S0225), SQLULDR2 & PINEGROVE (Oracle exfil), NATBypass, CLASSFON, certutil (S0160), BITSAdmin (S0190), and native LOLBins (Net, ipconfig, netstat, ping, dsquery, ftp).

## Emulation guidance (Decepticon)

> **Authorized use only:** Execute these techniques solely within the documented engagement scope, rules of engagement, and authorization window. Stay inside approved target ranges and obtain explicit sign-off before any destructive or impact-stage action.

Map APT41's signature behaviors to Decepticon's own capabilities:

- **Initial access (T1190, T1505.003):** Use Decepticon's recon/scanning and exploitation skills to identify and exploit an in-scope internet-facing app, then drop an in-scope **web shell** (emulate China Chopper / ANTSWORD behavior). Mirror APT41's defining trait: weaponize a recently disclosed CVE *fast* against the approved target.
- **Execution & ingress (T1105, T1218.011, T1197):** From the web shell, emulate the DUSTPAN pattern — use `certutil`/BITSAdmin (bash/Windows command skills) to pull a stager, then load via `rundll32` / DLL side-loading.
- **C2 (T1071.001, T1573.002, T1090, T1102.001):** Stand up **Sliver (c2/sliver skill)** as the BEACON analog over HTTPS. Emulate APT41 tradecraft with the **defense-evasion** kit: domain fronting / CDN proxying, web-service dead-drop resolvers, and DGA-style or non-standard-port profiles where the C2 framework supports it.
- **Defense evasion (T1574.001, T1027.002, T1553.002, T1562.006):** Use the **defense-evasion skill** for DLL search-order hijacking / side-loading, packing/obfuscation of the implant, signing test payloads with an authorized cert (emulating stolen-cert behavior), and ETW/event-log tampering — log every change for the blue cell.
- **Credential access (T1003.001/.003, T1550.002):** Use **AD skills** to dump LSASS, SAM, and `ntdsutil` ntds.dit, then perform Pass-the-Hash exactly as APT41 does with Mimikatz/Impacket-equivalent tooling.
- **Lateral movement (T1021.001/.002, T1047, T1570):** Use the **lateral-movement skill** to pivot via SMB/admin shares + WMI (wmiexec analog) and RDP, transferring the implant over remote shares.
- **Discovery (T1087, T1018, T1082, T1613):** Emulate APT41's `net`/`whoami`/`systeminfo`/`netstat` LOLBin survey via the bash/command skills and AD enumeration; add domain-trust discovery before pivoting.
- **Collection & exfil (T1119, T1213.006, T1048.003, T1567.002):** If databases are in scope, emulate SQLULDR2-style bulk extraction to staged CSVs, then exfiltrate via **DNS-subdomain encoding** or to **cloud storage** using the **cloud skills** — chunked to fixed sizes (T1030).
- **Impact (T1486):** Only if the ROE explicitly authorizes destructive emulation — otherwise simulate/flag the ransomware stage rather than executing it.

Recommended emulation chain (DUST campaign analog): *web shell → certutil/DUSTPAN-style dropper → side-loaded loader → Sliver BEACON over HTTPS/CDN → credential dump + PtH → SMB/WMI lateral movement → DB collection → DNS/cloud exfil.*

## Detection & defense

- **Web shells (T1505.003):** Monitor web roots for new/modified server-executable files; baseline web-server child processes (w3wp/httpd spawning cmd/powershell). Hunt for ANTSWORD/BLUEBEAM/China Chopper signatures and anomalous POST patterns.
- **Rapid CVE exploitation (T1190):** Aggressively patch internet-facing apps; prioritize the same families APT41 weaponizes (Citrix ADC, Exchange, ManageEngine, Log4j, niche LOB apps like USAHerds). Alert on exploitation attempts within hours of public PoC.
- **DLL side-loading & signed malware (T1574.001, T1553.002):** Detect legitimate signed binaries loading unsigned/anomalous DLLs from non-standard paths; track certificate-revocation and unexpected signer identities (stolen-cert reuse).
- **In-memory / fileless loaders (DUSTTRAP, T1027.013, T1055-style):** Deploy EDR with in-memory scanning; alert on encrypted payloads decrypted and executed in memory with minimal disk artifacts.
- **Telemetry tampering (T1562.006, T1070.005):** Alert on ETW provider disable/patch and Windows event-log clears; forward logs off-host so local clears don't blind the SOC.
- **Credential theft (T1003.x):** Detect LSASS access by non-system processes, `reg save` of SAM/SYSTEM, shadow-copy creation, and `ntdsutil`/NTDS access on DCs. Enable Credential Guard and LSASS protection.
- **Lateral movement (T1021.002, T1047, T1550.002):** Monitor remote service creation, WMI process creation events (Event ID 4688 + WMI-Activity), admin-share writes, and PtH indicators (NTLM logons from unexpected hosts). Tier/segment admin credentials.
- **C2 / exfil (T1071.004, T1048.003, T1090.004, T1567.002):** Inspect DNS for high-entropy/long subdomains and abnormal query volume; detect domain fronting and unexpected CDN/Cloudflare-Worker callbacks; monitor cloud-storage uploads (OneDrive) from servers and chunked transfer patterns.
- **General:** Restrict outbound from servers, enforce app allow-listing to curb LOLBin abuse (certutil/bitsadmin/rundll32), and hunt dead-drop-resolver beaconing to GitHub/Pastebin/Steam.
