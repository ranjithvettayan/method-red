"""complete_engagement_planning — signal soundwave-to-decepticon handoff.

Soundwave calls this exactly once after RoE / CONOPS / Deconfliction Plan
have been written, validated, and saved to ``/workspace/plan/``. The
emitted custom event tells the CLI to switch its LangGraph assistant_id from
``soundwave`` to ``decepticon`` so the next operator message lands on the
operations agent without the operator restarting the CLI.

The tool is a pure boolean signal — it carries no slug or other metadata.
The launcher is the single source of truth for the engagement slug; clients
inject ``engagement_name``/``workspace_path`` via ``config.configurable`` on
every run, and EngagementContextMiddleware hydrates them into agent state.
