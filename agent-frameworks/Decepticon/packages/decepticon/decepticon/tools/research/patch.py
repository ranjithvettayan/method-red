"""Patch generation + verification — Stage 4 of the vulnresearch pipeline.

The patcher agent uses the two tools exposed here to record a proposed
fix and to prove (or disprove) that the fix actually closes the
vulnerability. Both tools persist state through the existing
:class:`KnowledgeGraph` so the orchestrator can query "which findings
are still unpatched?" with a plain ``kg_query(kind='patch')``.

Data model
----------
- ``NodeKind.PATCH`` stores ``{vuln_id, finding_id, diff, commit_message,
  status, tests_passed, poc_still_fires, created_at, verified_at}``.
- A ``PATCHES`` edge links ``patch → vulnerability`` (and optionally
  ``patch → finding`` when a specific validated finding is being fixed).

``status`` lifecycle:
    proposed  → patch_propose just recorded the diff
    verified  → patch_verify re-ran the PoC and it no longer fires
    regressed → patch_verify found the PoC still fires OR tests failed

Verification
------------
``patch_verify`` re-runs the *original* PoC command (the one that
stage-3 :func:`~decepticon.research.tools.validate_finding` used) inside
the same sandbox via :func:`decepticon.research.poc.sandbox_runner`. If
none of the original success signals fire, the patch is accepted and the
linked vulnerability severity is flipped to ``info`` with a ``patched``
prop. If the signals still fire, the patch is rejected and the
vulnerability is left untouched so the patcher can iterate.

    WHEN TO USE: Stage 4. After reading the source around a
    ``VULNERABILITY`` node that has at least one ``VALIDATES`` finding,
    craft a minimal diff, and call this tool BEFORE applying it to disk
    so the proposal is captured in the graph even if apply fails.

    The recorded ``PATCH`` node carries a deterministic dedup key of
    ``"patch::{vuln_id}::{sha1(diff)}"``, so re-proposing the same diff
    is idempotent. Set ``applied=True`` only after you've actually
    written the diff to the target files via Edit/bash — the orchestrator
    uses this flag to decide whether :func:`patch_verify` needs to run
    the PoC at all.

    Args:
        vuln_id: Graph id of the vulnerability being fixed. MUST already
            have ``validated=True`` set by stage-3 validate_finding.
        diff: Unified-diff text of the proposed fix. Keep it minimal —
            no unrelated formatting, no doc changes, no new abstractions.
            Use ``git diff --no-color`` output, or a hand-written hunk.
        commit_message: Conventional-commit style summary, e.g.
            ``"fix(auth): use constant-time comparison in verify_hmac"``.
        finding_id: Optional id of a specific ``FINDING`` node this patch
            targets (when the vuln has multiple validated findings).
        applied: True if the diff has already been written to disk.

    WHEN TO USE: Stage 4, immediately after the patch has been written to
    disk. This tool is the single source of truth for "is the vuln
    actually fixed?" — the patcher agent MUST NOT claim completion
    without a green ``patch_verify``.

    Verification steps:
      1. Run ``test_cmd`` inside the sandbox (if provided). Any non-zero
         exit code marks the patch as ``regressed`` and the tool returns
         early without touching the vulnerability node.
      2. Run ``poc_command`` (usually the same string stage-3 verifier
         used) inside the sandbox and check whether any of the
         ``success_patterns`` still match. If none match, the patch is
         ``verified`` and the underlying vulnerability severity is flipped
         to ``info`` with a ``patched=True`` marker.

    The original vulnerability node and its finding history are
    preserved (audit trail); only ``severity`` and two bookkeeping props
    change on success.

    Args:
        patch_id: Graph id of the ``PATCH`` node from :func:`patch_propose`.
        poc_command: The bash PoC that originally demonstrated the bug.
            Usually the same string used by ``validate_finding`` at
            stage 3 — copy it from the finding's stdout log or the
            verifier's agent transcript.
        success_patterns: Comma-separated regexes that indicate the
            exploit still works. Identical format to ``validate_finding``.
        test_cmd: Optional regression/test command to run first (e.g.
            ``"cd /workspace/target && pytest -q tests/security/"``).
            A non-zero exit aborts verification.

    Returns:
        JSON with fields ``status`` (verified/regressed/tests_failed),
        ``poc_still_fires`` (bool), ``tests_passed`` (bool or null),
