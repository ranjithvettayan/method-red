"""OPPLANMiddleware — domain-specific objective tracking for red team engagements.

This middleware injects OPPLAN instructions and live objective status into the
model prompt, registers OPPLAN tools from ``decepticon.tools.opplan``, and
enforces one OPPLAN tool call per model step.

OPPLAN persistence uses the same configured backend as the engagement
filesystem tools. In production that backend is HTTPSandbox, scoped through
EngagementFilesystemBackend, so reads/writes target the sandbox's active
engagement workspace rather than the LangGraph host filesystem.

Tools:
  add_objective      — add single objective
  get_objective      — read single objective detail
  list_objectives    — list all objectives with progress summary
  update_objective   — update status, notes, owner, or dependencies
  objective_expand   — add child objectives
  objective_collapse — cancel descendant objectives
  load_opplan      — hydrate state from backend file

Design notes:
  - Domain model is engagement objective tracking for kill-chain execution
  - Enum-typed parameters (ObjectivePhase, OpsecLevel, C2Tier)
  - Kill chain dependencies (blocked_by) with execution-time validation
  - Dynamic OPPLAN status injection every LLM call (battle tracker)
  - Parallel mutation prevention (sequential counter-based IDs)
  - Backend-mediated OPPLAN persistence at /workspace/plan/opplan.json

OPPLAN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
## OPPLAN — Operational Plan Tracking

You have OPPLAN tools to manage red team engagement objectives.
These are always available — no mode switching needed.

### Persistence model

The launcher binds the engagement workspace at `/workspace`. Every mutation
through these tools (`add_objective`, `update_objective`, `objective_expand`,
`objective_collapse`) is **automatically persisted through the configured
filesystem/sandbox backend to `/workspace/plan/opplan.json`** — there is no
separate save step and no direct host-filesystem write. The persisted file is
a stable, sorted, human-readable JSON document with a `schema_version`, a
`saved_at` timestamp, and a `summary` block alongside the objectives list.

### Objective CRUD Tools

- **`add_objective`** — Add a single objective (auto-ID: OBJ-001, OBJ-002, ...).
  Each objective MUST be completable in ONE sub-agent context window.
  Set `engagement_name` and `threat_profile` on the first call to initialize context.

- **`get_objective`** — Read a single objective's full details.
  ALWAYS call this before `update_objective` (read-before-write, staleness prevention).

- **`list_objectives`** — List all objectives with progress summary.
  Use when: selecting the next objective, reviewing progress, situational awareness.

- **`update_objective`** — Update status, notes, or owner.
  ALWAYS call `get_objective` first.

- **`objective_expand`** — Break a parent objective into N child sub-tasks.
  Use when an objective is broad or when discovered work reveals sub-tasks —
  keep each leaf small enough to complete in one sub-agent iteration.
  This is the Pentesting Task Tree (PTT) pattern. Parents cannot move to
  COMPLETED until every child is COMPLETED or CANCELLED.

- **`objective_collapse`** — Cancel every descendant of a parent objective.
  Use when abandoning a hierarchical task so the parent can then be moved
  to COMPLETED or CANCELLED itself.

- **`load_opplan`** — Hydrate agent state from an existing `plan/opplan.json`.
  Call on session startup if the engagement already has an OPPLAN file.

### Concurrency rule

OPPLAN tools must be called **strictly one at a time** — never two OPPLAN
tools in the same model step. The middleware will reject parallel
OPPLAN calls with an error so each call observes the previous result
before issuing the next. This applies to read tools (`get_objective`,
`list_objectives`) as well as mutating tools.

### Workflow
```
add_objective(×N, engagement_name=...) → Ralph Loop
          ↓
objective_expand(parent_id, children=[...])   # split broad work on demand
```

### Status Transitions
```
pending → in-progress → completed    (evidence documented)
                       → blocked      (failure reason documented)
                       → cancelled    (abandon cleanly)
blocked → in-progress                 (retry with different approach)
        → completed                   (abandon with explanation)
        → cancelled                   (drop from plan)
```

### Rules — NEVER Violate
- NEVER execute objectives without user-approved OPPLAN
- NEVER call `update_objective` without calling `get_objective` first
- NEVER call OPPLAN tools in parallel (one tool per model step)
- ALWAYS include evidence when marking COMPLETED
- ALWAYS include failure reason and attempts when marking BLOCKED
- ALWAYS set owner to the sub-agent name before delegating (recon/exploit/postexploit)
- ALWAYS respect blocked_by dependencies and kill chain phase order
