"""Anti-drift guards for the agent registries.

Three independent registries must stay in lock-step or an agent silently
half-wires: the ``decepticon.subagents`` entry-point group (what the
orchestrator can dispatch), the LangGraph manifests (what can be served
as a standalone graph), and the role tables in ``decepticon_core``
(slots + model tiers). The ``phisher`` / ``mobile_operator`` /
``wireless_operator`` agents shipped registered as subagents but absent
from ``graph_registry`` / ``langgraph.json`` — these tests would have
failed on that drift; keep them green.
