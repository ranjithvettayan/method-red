"""Network-isolation invariants for ``docker-compose.yml``.

These assertions encode the structural security boundaries that no
single Semgrep / lint rule can catch. They run on the *rendered* compose
file (``docker compose config``) so they validate the post-interpolation
shape that actually starts on a contributor's host.

Invariants
----------

1. **Operational services never join the management network.**
   The Kali sandbox, the C2 framework, and the optional Ghidra MCP
   sidecar are sandbox-net only. Adding any of them to
   ``decepticon-net`` collapses the management/operational boundary
   that the architecture is built around (see
   ``docs/security/sandbox-isolation.md``).

2. **No service uses host networking.** ``network_mode: host`` bypasses
   both bridges and defeats the isolation entirely.

3. **No service mounts the Docker socket.** The HTTP-only sandbox
   migration removed ``/var/run/docker.sock`` from the LangGraph
   service deliberately; reintroducing it would re-open a
   container-escape path from a compromised orchestrator.

4. **Every published port binds to 127.0.0.1.** Bare ``PORT:PORT``
   (which docker resolves to ``0.0.0.0``) exposes internal services to
   the contributor's LAN. The existing compose already follows this
   convention; the test fences it.

5. **Dual-homed services are explicitly allowlisted.** Today
   ``neo4j`` and ``langgraph`` are intentionally on both networks.
   Adding a third forces an explicit update to ``DUAL_HOMED_SERVICES``
   below, which is what we want — silent additions are how an
   isolation boundary erodes.

If you are extending the compose file and one of these assertions
fires, the message points at the invariant being violated and what to
update. **Do not** weaken the test to make a change land; either fix
the compose, or open an ADR that supersedes the invariant.
