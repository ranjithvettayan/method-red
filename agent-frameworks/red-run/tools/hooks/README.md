# Hooks

Claude Code hook scripts for red-run engagement logging and state monitoring.
Configured in `.claude/settings.json` by `install.sh`.

## Scripts

### save-agent-log.sh

SubagentStop hook that copies agent JSONL transcripts to
`engagement/evidence/logs/` for post-engagement analysis.

**Trigger:** Runs automatically when any Claude Code subagent stops.

**Behavior:**

1. Reads hook JSON from stdin (`agent_transcript_path`, `agent_type`)
2. Checks that transcript file exists
3. Checks that `engagement/evidence/logs/` directory exists — exits silently
   if not (graceful degradation when no engagement is active)
4. Copies transcript with filename `{ISO-timestamp}-{agent-type}.jsonl`
   (e.g., `20260227T143052Z-web-exploit-agent.jsonl`)
5. Always exits 0 to never block Claude Code

**Scope:** Only triggers for red-run domain agents (network-recon,
web-discovery, web-exploit, ad-discovery, ad-exploit, password-spray,
linux-privesc, windows-privesc, evasion, credential-recovery). Built-in
subagents (Explore, Plan, general-purpose) produce transcripts too, but
are filtered by agent type naming.

**Dependencies:** `jq` for JSON parsing.

### save-teammate-log.sh

TeammateIdle hook that copies teammate JSONL transcripts to
`engagement/evidence/logs/` and checks for AUP/content filter errors.

**Trigger:** Runs automatically when any agent teams teammate goes idle.

**Behavior:**

1. Reads hook JSON from stdin (`transcript_path`, `session_id`, `teammate_name`)
2. Checks that transcript file and engagement directory exist — exits silently
   if not
3. Copies transcript with filename `{timestamp}-teammate-{name}-{session}.jsonl`
4. **AUP detection:** Scans the last 200 lines of the transcript for content
   filter patterns (content_policy, "I cannot assist", flagged request, etc.)
5. If AUP detected, writes a sentinel file to
   `engagement/evidence/aup-{teammate}.flag` with timestamp, session ID, and
   the matching transcript lines
6. Always exits 0 to never block the teammate

**AUP sentinel files:** The orchestrator should check for
`engagement/evidence/aup-*.flag` files when a teammate goes silent. If found,
the teammate's context is poisoned — dismiss and respawn with a clean context
if needed.

**Dependencies:** `jq` for JSON parsing.

### event-watcher.sh

Background poller for the `state_events` table in engagement state. Legacy
script for the subagent-based orchestrator (`/red-run-legacy`). The agent
teams orchestrator (`/red-run-ctf`) uses teammate messages instead.

**Usage:**

```bash
bash tools/hooks/event-watcher.sh <cursor> <db_path>
```

- `cursor` — last seen `state_events.id` (0 to get all events)
- `db_path` — path to `engagement/state.db`

**Behavior:**

1. Polls `state_events` every 5 seconds for rows with `id > cursor`
2. When events are detected, waits 60 seconds (debounce) to let the agent
   finish its batch of writes
3. Prints all new events as JSON array and exits 0
4. Times out after 30 minutes with `{"timeout": true, "cursor": N}` to
   prevent zombie watchers

**Dependencies:** `python3` with `sqlite3` stdlib module (no sqlite3 CLI
needed).

## Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` under the `hooks` key.
The installer sets this up automatically. Example configuration:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "matcher": "...",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash /path/to/red-run/tools/hooks/save-agent-log.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "TeammateIdle": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash /path/to/red-run/tools/hooks/save-teammate-log.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
