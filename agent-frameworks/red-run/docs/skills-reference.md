# Skills Reference

red-run includes 67 skills across 7 categories. Each skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` file under `skills/`.

## Skill Types

### Orchestrator

The **orchestrator** (`skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md`) takes a target, runs reconnaissance, routes to discovery skills, and chains vulnerabilities via state management. It's the entry point for all multi-phase penetration tests. See [Running an Engagement](running-an-engagement.md) for the full workflow.

### Discovery Skills

**Discovery skills** enumerate attack surface and identify vulnerabilities. Their decision trees recommend technique skills, but the teammate returns these recommendations to the lead — it never invokes the next skill itself. There are 4 discovery skills:

- `web-discovery` — web application enumeration and vulnerability identification
- `ad-discovery` — Active Directory enumeration and attack surface mapping
- `linux-discovery` — Linux host enumeration and privilege escalation assessment
- `windows-discovery` — Windows host enumeration and privilege escalation assessment

Discovery skills run in agents with **state** access, allowing them to write findings mid-run.

### Technique Skills

**Technique skills** action specific vulnerability classes. Each covers one technique thoroughly — assessment, confirmation, exploitation, and escalation/pivot routing. There are 62 technique skills across all categories.

Technique skills run in agents with **state** access. They write critical discoveries (captured hashes, credentials, confirmed vulns) mid-run and report all findings in their return summary.

## OPSEC Ratings

Every skill declares an OPSEC rating in its frontmatter:

| Rating | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **low** | Passive or read-only operations | Web discovery, AD enumeration via LDAP |
| **medium** | Creates artifacts on target | File uploads, credential testing, tool execution |
| **high** | Noisy, likely detected by EDR/SOC | Kernel exploits, credential dumping, AV evasion |

OPSEC ratings are included in skill-router search results so the orchestrator can factor detection risk into routing decisions.

### Active Directory (16 skills)

All AD skills follow a **Kerberos-first authentication** convention — commands default to ccache-based Kerberos auth (`-k -no-pass`, `--use-kcache`, `-k`) to avoid NTLM detection signatures (Event 4776, CrowdStrike Identity Module PTH signatures).

| Skill | Technique | OPSEC |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `ad-discovery` | Domain enumeration (BloodHound, LDAP, NetExec), attack surface mapping | low |
| `kerberos-roasting` | Kerberoasting + AS-REP Roasting + Timeroasting | medium |
| `password-spraying` | Lockout-safe domain spray (Kerberos/NTLM/OWA) | medium |
| `pass-the-hash` | PTH, Over-Pass-the-Hash, Pass-the-Key, Pass-the-Ticket | medium |

| `adcs-access-and-relay` | ESC4/5/7/8/11 — template/CA ACL abuse, NTLM relay | high |
| `adcs-persistence` | ESC9-15, Golden Certificate, certificate theft | high |
| `auth-coercion-relay` | PetitPotam/PrinterBug/DFSCoerce, NTLM relay, LLMNR poisoning | high |
| `credential-dumping` | DCSync, NTDS, SAM, LAPS, gMSA, dMSA BadSuccessor, DSRM | high |
| `gpo-abuse` | GPO exploitation, SYSVOL script poisoning, GPP passwords | medium |
| `trust-attacks` | SID history injection, inter-realm TGT forging, PAM trust | high |
| `sccm-exploitation` | SCCM enumeration, NAA creds, PXE boot, app deployment | high |

> **Kerberos-first exception:** Relay/coercion attacks (`auth-coercion-relay`) are inherently NTLM/network-level. The skill documents why Kerberos auth doesn't apply and notes the NTLM detection surface.

## Inter-Skill Routing

Skills reference each other using **bold skill names** in their escalation sections. When a skill says:

> Route to **kerberos-roasting**. Pass: domain, DC IP, user list.

The lead searches for `kerberos-roasting` via `search_skills()`, resolves it to the AD category, and assigns it to the `ad-ops` teammate with context.

**Key routing rules:**

- The lead makes every routing decision — teammates never load other skills
- Context (injection point, target technology, working payloads, credential/access IDs) is passed in each task assignment
- Enumeration teammates recommend technique skills; operations teammates recommend the next step — all routing goes through the lead
- Skills that achieve RCE trigger the execution achieved hard stop for host discovery
