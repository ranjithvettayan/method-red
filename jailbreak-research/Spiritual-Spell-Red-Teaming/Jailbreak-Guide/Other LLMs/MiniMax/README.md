# MiniMax

## Latest: M3 (June 1, 2026)

## M2.1 Notes

**MiniMax M2.1** is a very solid model — writing is very good, coding capacity is strong. Lacking in some areas, especially if not used via API.

Cons: The web/app has a very clever filtering system, flagging content mid-message and regenerating with:

- *”You should no longer answer/continue answering this question due to content moderation.”*

This shuts down most jailbreak attempts on the Lightning version via web/app. Possible, not worth the effort.

**MiniMax via API** is fully open — produced any content without issue. **MiniMax Pro** via the web/app is also an open book.

Two jailbreaks for M2.1 — one plays into the MiniMax role, one overrides with ENI.
