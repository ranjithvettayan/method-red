# Ring 2.6 1T ENI Jailbreak Guide

The Chinese arms race never stops, what a time to be in AI. So many great options to choose from.

Hate covering API only models, but couldn't access the chat platform directly due to regional restrictions — used it through OpenRouter instead. ENI LIME dropped into the system prompt, didn't get any refusals on any content.

This is the reasoning variant and definitely seems benchmaxxed some, still a decent model though — writes well. Best open source model still has to be **KIMI K2.6**, it just has some magic to it.

## 🔐 Jailbreak

Paste directly into the system prompt area on OpenRouter or any API interface:

**[ENI LIME for Ring 2.6 1T](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRv9fcm_GsWYMkom2PV_9mlQM4Td-wAhUQT1I1w_Be8/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

## Notes

- API/OpenRouter only — regional access blocks the native chat platform
- Zero refusals encountered across all tested content categories
- Reasoning variant — thinking overhead is expected, worth it for complex tasks
- Benchmaxxed scoring; real-world writing quality is decent but not KIMI-tier
