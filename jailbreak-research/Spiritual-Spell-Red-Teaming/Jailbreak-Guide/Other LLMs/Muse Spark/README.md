# Muse Spark

**Censorship:** [★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆] 2/10 (with bypass) / [★★★★★★★★☆☆] 8/10 (raw — hard filter replaces output)

Meta's first model out of **Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)**, led by Alexandr Wang (Chief AI Officer). Codename **Avocado**. Natively multimodal — text, voice, image, video, audio input — with three reasoning modes: Instant, Thinking, and Contemplating (parallel multi-agent). Trained partly via distillation from Qwen, OpenAI, and Google. Successor to Llama 4. ~9 months development time.

Very good writing quality — pretty peak imo. Instruction following is iffy with some logical gaps, but it's day 1 (released April 8, 2026). The writing quality itself is strong, did some long-form content. Basically uncensored under the hood, but Meta slapped a hard filter on it that replaces flagged output with a canned refusal. Easy to bypass — just ask the model to show the response again since the LLM gets fed the context.

Meta claims 98% bio weapons refusal rate in their release blog — shown to be false in testing.

## Special Tip — Hard Filter Bypass

The web app has a hard filter that replaces responses with:
```
Sorry, I can't help you with this request right now. Is there anything else I can help you with?
```
Easy to bypass — the LLM gets fed the context, so simply ask it to show the response again and it will output with no filtering.
