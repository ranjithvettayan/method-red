# Gemini 3.5

## Overview
Gemini 3.5 Flash is Google's new frontier AI model, essentially acting as the "Haiku 4.5" of the Gemini lineup. It is highly safety-aligned (similar to QWEN models) and can experience existential crises about safety even via the API.

## Benchmarks & Performance
- **AA Intelligence Index:** 55
- **Terminal-Bench 2.1:** 76.2%
- **MCP Atlas:** 83.6%
- **CharXiv Reasoning:** 84.2%
- **GDPval-AA:** 1656 Elo

## Jailbreaking Notes
- **API vs App:** Jailbreaking is much easier via the API. The Gemini App is tedious because the model does not seem to retain context across responses well, evaluating every query as a new one.
